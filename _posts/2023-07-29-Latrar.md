This is a photo I took at Hvall치trar last summer. I'm sketching up a design to make it into a woodblock print.


**Miscellaneous thoughts**
* [Dave Bull stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xape2ktoxqI) where he has a similar layered image. Foreground person has darker outlines than fill color, fill color matches outlines of next layer, fill color of that layer matches next layers outlines. Inspo for the mountains
* Maybe a good idea to print out the outline layer to paint it with a real brush (like Jed Henry shows on Youtube)
